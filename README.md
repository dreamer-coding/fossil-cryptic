# **Fossil Cryptic by Fossil Logic**

**Fossil Cryptic** is a lightweight, portable cryptography library written in pure C with zero external dependencies. Designed for maximum portability and security, Fossil Cryptic provides a suite of cryptographic primitives, hash functions, and secure utilities suitable for embedded, trust-critical, and cross-platform applications. Its minimal footprint and audit-friendly codebase make it ideal for developers needing reliable, verifiable cryptography in constrained or security-sensitive environments.

### Key Features

- **Cross-Platform Support**  
  Runs seamlessly on Windows, macOS, Linux, and embedded systems without modification.

- **Zero External Dependencies**  
  Written entirely in clean, portable C to maximize auditability and ease of integration.

- **Robust Cryptographic Primitives**  
  Includes secure hash algorithms, keyed hashes, encryption helpers, and authentication mechanisms.

- **Lightweight and Efficient**  
  Optimized for minimal resource usage, making it ideal for embedded and low-power devices.

- **Self-Contained & Auditable**  
  All cryptographic operations are fully transparent and easy to review for correctness and security.

- **Modular Design**  
  Easily extendable and customizable to fit your project‚Äôs specific cryptographic requirements.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Meson Build System**  
  Fossil Cryptic uses Meson for build configuration. If you don‚Äôt have Meson installed, please follow the installation instructions on the official [Meson website](https://mesonbuild.com/Getting-meson.html).

### Adding Fossil Cryptic as a Dependency

#### Using Meson

### **Install or Upgrade Meson** (version 1.3 or newer recommended):

```sh
   python -m pip install meson           # Install Meson
   python -m pip install --upgrade meson # Upgrade Meson
```
###	Add the .wrap File
Place a file named fossil-cryptic.wrap in your subprojects directory with the following content:

```ini
# ======================
# Git Wrap package definition
# ======================
[wrap-git]
url = https://github.com/fossillogic/fossil-cryptic.git
revision = v0.1.0

[provide]
fossil-cryptic = fossil_cryptic_dep
```

###	Integrate in Your meson.build
Add the dependency by including this line:

```meson
cryptic_dep = dependency('fossil-cryptic')
```


## Build Configuration Options

Customize your build with the following Meson options:
	‚Ä¢	Enable Tests
To run the built-in test suite, configure Meson with:

```sh
meson setup builddir -Dwith_test=enabled
```

### Tests Double as Samples

The project is designed so that **test cases serve two purposes**:

- ‚úÖ **Unit Tests** ‚Äì validate the framework‚Äôs correctness.  
- üìñ **Usage Samples** ‚Äì demonstrate how to use these libraries through test cases.  

This approach keeps the codebase compact and avoids redundant ‚Äúhello world‚Äù style examples.  
Instead, the same code that proves correctness also teaches usage.  

This mirrors the **Meson build system** itself, which tests its own functionality by using Meson to test Meson.  
In the same way, Fossil Logic validates itself by demonstrating real-world usage in its own tests via Fossil Test.  

```bash
meson test -C builddir -v
```

Running the test suite gives you both verification and practical examples you can learn from.
